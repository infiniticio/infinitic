Logs are generated based on the messages circulating in the system's topics.
These logs are encoded in the [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) Avro binary format,
setting them apart from the internally used format.

Each log entry includes a timestamp, ensuring the correct order of events.
When working with Pulsar, these timestamps originate from the corresponding Pulsar messages.
This approach enables the proper sequencing of logs,
even when log consumers process different topics.

The log messages include both internal system messages and additional ones
that serve logging purposes only.
For instance, `TaskStarted` messages are not utilized by Infinitic.
They are generated by Service workers exclusively for the logs.

Log files should be sufficiently detailed to allow for effective debugging
when they are collectively examined.
Specifically, there should be an inclusion of the worker name at every single step.
